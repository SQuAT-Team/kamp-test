           title = {Synchronization of Models on Different Abstraction Levels using Triple Graph Grammars},
         address = {Darmstadt},
        abstract = {In modern, computer-aided engineering processes, restoring and maintaining the consistency of multiple, related artefacts is an important challenge. This is especially the case in multi-disciplinary domains such as manufacturing engineering, where complex systems are described using multiple artefacts that are concurrently manipulated by domain experts, each with their own established tools.
Bidirectional languages address this challenge of consistency maintenance by supporting incremental change propagation with a clear and precise semantics. Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) are a prominent rule-based and declarative bidirectional model transformation language with various implementations, and a solid formal foundation based on algebraic graph transformations.
Although TGGs are well suited for synchronizing models that are already on an appropriate, high-level of abstraction, practical model synchronization chains typically require handling models on different levels of abstraction. This poses additional challenges including: (i) handling massive information loss typically incurred when abstracting from a low-level model to a high-level model, (ii) supporting complex attribute manipulation as low-level models are often simple trees extracted from textual or XML-files, with relevant information encoded in attribute values rather than structural relations, and (iii) enabling arbitrary structural constraints to cope with complex, often recursive structural context relations, which are usually not present as explicit links in low-level models.

This thesis addresses these challenges by: 
(1) Establishing a general framework for organizing and structuring model synchronization chains. This framework is applied to an industrial case study in the domain of manufacturing engineering, which is used consequently throughout this thesis to identify requirements, formulate corresponding challenges, and evaluate the contributions of this thesis.
(2) Identifying and formalizing new language extensions for TGGs: attribute conditions for complex attribute manipulation in TGG rules, and dynamic conditions for integrating arbitrary structural constraints. To guarantee the maintainability of large TGG specifications, a new modularity concept for TGGs, rule refinement is also introduced. Similar to inheritance and composition for programming languages, rule refinement enables the reuse and flexible combination of TGG rule fragments to form similar TGG rules without introducing redundancy in specifications.
(3) Extending an existing TGG-based synchronization algorithm to cover these new features with formal proofs of correctness and completeness (well-behavedness) of derived TGG-based synchronizers.
(4) Providing formal construction techniques and static analyses for all properties and restrictions required to guarantee the well-behavedness of derived synchronizers.},

	its coverage to technology. Writing for both technical and nontechnical
	decision-makers, this book covers everything that impacts scalability,
	including architecture, processes, people, and organizations. Throughout,
	the authors address a broad spectrum of real-world challenges, from
	performance testing to IT governance. Using their tools and guidance,
	organizations can systematically overcome obstacles to scalability
	and achieve unprecedented levels of technical and business performance.
	Coverage includes Staffing the scalable organization: essential organizational,
	management, and leadership skills for technical leaders Building
	processes for scale: process lessons from hyper-growth companies,
	from technical issue resolution to crisis management Making better
	"build versus buy" decisions Architecting scalable solutions: powerful
	proprietary models for identifying scalability needs and choosing

	Girard et al., 1989) deals with terms and types; R is an extension
	of F that deals also with relations between types. In R, it is possible
	to derive theorems about functions from their types, or 'theorems
	for free', as P. Wadler (1989) calls them. An easy 'theorem for free'
	asserts that the type For all (X)X to Bool contains only constant
	functions; this is not provable in F. There are many harder and more
	substantial examples. Various metatheorems can also be obtained.},

	better enforcement of disciplined programming styles, and generation
	of more efficient object code than languages where all type consistency
	checks are performed at run time. However, even in statically typed
	languages, there is often the need to deal with data whose type cannot
	be determined at compile time. To handle such situations safely,
	we propose to add a type Dynamic whose values are pairs of a value
	v and a type tag T where v has the type denoted by T. Instances of
	Dynamic are built with an explicit tagging construct and inspected
	with a type safe typecas construct. This paper explores the syntax,
	operational semantics, and denotational semantics of a simple language
	including the type Dynamic.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the vision of Concern-Driven Development (CDD), a novel software development paradigm that extends model-driven engineering with best practices from reuse, advanced modularization techniques, goal modelling, and software product line research. CDD advocates the use of a three-part interface to describe units of reuse, i.e., concerns. The variation interface de- scribes required design decisions and their impact on high level system qualities, both explicitly expressed using feature models and goal models. The customization interface allows the chosen variation to be adapted to a specific reuse context, while the us- age interface defines how a customized concern may eventually be used. When a concern is reused, the modeller first uses the varia- tion interface to select the feature configuration that has the desired impact on stakeholder goals and system qualities, then adapts the concern to the context of the application under development with the help of the customization interface, and finally accesses the concern’s functionality through its usage interface. We argue that, if CDD is successfully adopted on a large scale, it will transform the software engineering discipline by enabling software engineers to specialize to a greater degree and hence align the practice of software engineering closer to what is done in other engineering disciplines.},

	software architecture---becomes a central design problem. An important
	step toward an engineering discipline of software is a formal basis
	for describing and analyzing these designs. In the article we present
	a formal approach to one aspect of architectural design: the interactions
	among components. The key idea is to define architectural connectors
	as explicit semantic entities. These are specified as a collection
	of protocols that characterize each of the participant roles in an
	interaction and how these roles interact. We illustrate how this
	scheme can be used to define a variety of common architectural connectors.
	We further provide a formal semantics and show how this leads to
	a system in which architectural compatibility can be checked in a
	way analogous to type-checking in programming languages.},

  abstract = {The importance of early performance assessment grows as software systems
	increase in terms of size, logical distribution and interaction complexity.
	Lack of time from the side of software developers, as well as distance
	among software model notations and performance model representation
	do not help to build an integrated software process that takes into
	account, from the early phases of the lifecycle, non functional requirements.
	In this paper we work towards filling this gap by extending the capabilities
	of a simulative environment developed for the UML notation. Out intent
	is to introduce new stereotypes representing performance related
	items, such as resource types and job dispatchers. They allow the
	software designers to homogeneously represent a software architecture
	integrated with a running platform as well as parameterized with
	the resource demand that the components require.}

  abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing
	has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making
	software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT
	hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas
	for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large
	capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human
	expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning
	for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus
	wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes
	wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover,
	companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as
	quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for
	one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This
	elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale,
	is unprecedented in the history of IT. The economies of scale of
	very large-scale datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource
	usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive
	to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet
	Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully
	scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue.
	Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns
	could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks
	of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing
	provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over
	a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due
	better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger
	scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies
	the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify
	Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles
	and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.},

	We introduce an approach that can model resource sharing separately
	from function invocations, keeping the performance model reasonably
	simple while still describing many of the effects of resource sharing
	on the duration of function invocations. The approach has been tested
	on the CoCoME component application modeling example.},

  pages = {207--258},
  abstract = {When tackling the construction of a software system, at the software
	architecture design level there are two main issues related to the
	system performance. First, the designer may need to choose among
	several alternative software architectures for the system, with the
	choice being driven especially by performance considerations. Second,
	for a specific software architecture of the system, the designer
	may want to understand whether its performance can be improved and,
	if so, it would be desirable for the designer to have some diagnostic
	information that guide the modification of the software architecture
	itself. In this paper we show how these two issues can be addressed
	in practice by employing a methodology relying on the combined use
	of Emilia an architectural description language based on stochastic
	process algebra and queueing networks structured performance models
	equipped with fast solution algorithms which allows for a quick prediction,
	improvement, and comparison of the performance of different software
	architectures for a given system. The methodology is illustrated
	through a case study in which a sequential architecture, a pipeline
	architecture, and a concurrent architecture for a compiler system
	are compared on the basis of typical average performance indices.},

	relations give information on how to curry on the development process

  abstract = {Reuse of products, processes and knowledge will be the key to enable
	the software industry to achieve the dramatic improvement in productivity
	and quality required to satisfy the anticipated growing demands.
	Although experience shows the certain kinds of reuse can be successful,
	general success has been elusive. A software life-cycle technology
	which allows broad and extensive reuse could provide the means to
	achieving the desired order-of-magnitude improvements. This paper
	motivates and outlines the scope of a comprehensive framework for
	understanding, planning, evaluating, and motivating reuse practices
	and the necessary research activities. As a first step towards such
	a framework, a reuse-enabling software evolution environment model
	is introduced which provides a basis for the effective recording
	of experience, the generalization and tailoring of experience, the
	formalization of experience, and the re-/use of experience.},
