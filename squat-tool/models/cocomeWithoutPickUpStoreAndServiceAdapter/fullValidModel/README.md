This is a version of the Cocome model which is complete (all the different models for the performance analysis are available) and valid (no validation errors of the models). The goal is to have a analyzable model, not a completely realistic one. 

**Allocation Model:**

According to the figure on p. 36 of the Cocome paper. This is probably the final, realistic allocation model.

**Resource Environment Model:**

(Temporarily) Increased CPU speed to extremely high to prevent unsolvable models. This model has to be refined later.

**Usage Model:**

Calls the currently only 4 semi-implemented front-interface-methods. Adjusted arrival rate to prevent unsolvable models. This model has to be refined later.
