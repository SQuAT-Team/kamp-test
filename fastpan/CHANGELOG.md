## [UNRELEASED]


## v1.0.0 - 2016-11-29

- Release `v1.0.0` for thesis completion.


## v0.4.0 - 2016-11-02

### Added
- Add `BackedFeatureModel` and `BackedConfiguration` to integrate 3rd-party feature models and configurations.

### Changed
- BC Break: `FeatureModel` and `Configuration` are now interfaces. Use `BaseFeatureModel` and `BaseConfiguration` to upgrade from v0.3.0.
- BC Break: changed argument order of `VariabilityAnalyzer#setupAnalysis`.


## v0.3.0 - 2016-10-28

### Changed
- The `Feature` class has been removed and can be replaced by direct references to the feature class.
- The `Configuration` offers a better API.


## v0.2.2 - 2016-10-27

### Added
- Objective interfaces to reduce performance results for further analysis.
- `BaseAnalyzer` to simply analyze a collection of configurations and retrieve all `PerformanceResult`s. 


## v0.2.1 - 2016-10-20

### Added
- Convenient builder for `Result`s: `de.fakeller.performance.analysis.result.Attach`.

### Changed
- `BusyTime`/`IdleTime` do not require a time unit anymore. Times are in milliseconds by default.
- Convenience methods in `PerformanceResultWriter` have been removed. Use `Attach` builder to create results instead.


## v0.2.0 - 2016-10-18

### Changed
- A `PerformanceResult` is now attached to an element and has a `PerformanceMetric` (which is to be seen as some mathematical operation, such as `mean()`). The `PerformanceMetric` itself then contains a `PerformanceQuantity` that reasons about the actual value and unit.


## v0.1.2 - 2016-10-12

### Added
- Added `getMetric()` to `PerformanceResult`.


## v0.1.1 - 2016-10-12 [Maintenance Release]

No changes


## v0.1.0 - 2016-10-12

### Changed
- The project has been named "fastpan". The naming has been updated throughput the project. Check your maven dependencies.

### Added
- Define variability analyzer abstraction with a simplified feature model.


## v0.0.2 - 2016-10-11

### Changed
- Maven groupId from `de.fabiankeller.performance` to `de.fakeller.performance`.


## v0.0.1 - 2016-10-11

### Added
- First draft of performance analyzer abstraction extracted from the [palladio headless](https://github.com/DECLARE-Project/palladio-headless) project.
 
### Changed
- Changed package namespace from `de.fabiankeller.*` to `de.fakeller.*` to comply with Java naming conventions.
