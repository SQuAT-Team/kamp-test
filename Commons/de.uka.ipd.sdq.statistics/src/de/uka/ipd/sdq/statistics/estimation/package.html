This package contains various statistical estimators. There are 
point estimators and confidence estimators, represented by the interfaces 
{@link IPointEstimator} and {@link IConfidenceEstimator}. An estimator 
implements one or both of them.
<h3>How to implement a new estimator?</h3>
If your implementation is intended to provide solely point estimation or 
confidence estimation implement only the corresponding interface. Otherwise
both interfaces have to be implemented. It is recommended to create a single
class implementing both interfaces in contrast to create one class per 
interface.
