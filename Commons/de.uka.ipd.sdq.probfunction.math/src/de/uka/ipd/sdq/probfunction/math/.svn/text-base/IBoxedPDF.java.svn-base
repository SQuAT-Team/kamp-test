 * A BoxedPDF is an approximation of an actual probability density function. It seperates the
 * function in a set of arbitrary, but non-overlapping intervals (boxes). For each such interval
 * [a,b), the probability of a sample lying in that interval (F(b) - F(a)) is stored in a BoxedPDF. <br>
 * 
 * A BoxedPDF consists of an ordered set of ContinuousSamples, which contains the x and y
 * coordinates of the upper right corner of a box. The lower left corner is given by the x
 * coordinate of its left neighbour and the y coordinate is set to zero. This allows us to easily
 * construct a sequence of boxes. The lower left corner of the leftmost box is always (0,0).
