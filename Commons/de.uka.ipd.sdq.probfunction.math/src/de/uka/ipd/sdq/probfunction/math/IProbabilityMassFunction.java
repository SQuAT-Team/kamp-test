/**
 * A probability mass function (abbreviated pmf) gives the probability that a discrete random
 * variable is exactly equal to some value. A probability mass function differs from a probability
 * density function in that the values of the latter, defined only for continuous random variables,
 * are not probabilities; rather, its integral over a set of possible values of the random variable
 * is a probability.
 * 
 * Note that the operations defined here are not suitable to add and multiply random numbers in
 * general (e.g. in the DependencySolver). They are defined per-value and are required for internal
 * computations (e.g. Fourier Transformation).
